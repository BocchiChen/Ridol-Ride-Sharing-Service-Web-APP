    <h1>Your Best Ride Sharing System</h1>
    <p class="lead">Ridol is a transportation company whose app allows riders to request rides, and drivers collect fares and get paid. More specifically, Ridol is a ride-sharing company that employs independent contractors as drivers. It is one of many services contributing to the sharing economy today, providing a way to connect to existing resources rather than providing the physical resources themselves.</p>

    <p class="lead">Using a ride-sharing app like Ridol has several advantages over more traditional modes of transportation. As mentioned earlier, Ridol's dynamic pricing model attracts drivers to certain areas at critical times, making it more likely that cars will be available during times of high passenger demand. Ridol's app also lets users see a map showing all potential drivers in the area. Once a driver is selected, riders can see their driver navigate to the pick-up location in real-time, with an updated estimated time of arrival. This provides great convenience when coordinating rides. From a broader perspective, Ridol shares benefits with other components of the sharing economy. The benefit of this is that companies following the sharing model are theoretically able to more efficiently use underutilized assets such as tools, clothes, houses and, in Ridol's case, cars.</p>
